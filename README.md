# Assignment4

Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors
Reads the content of a file named sample.txt.

Prints the file content line by line.

Gracefully handles errors using try and except if the file is missing.

Example error message:
"Error: sample.txt file not found."

Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File
Prompts the user for input and writes it to output.txt.

Appends additional content to the same file.

Reads and prints the final content of the file to confirm both write and append worked.

ðŸš€ How to Run
Make sure Assignment4.py is in your working directory.

If testing Task 1, ensure sample.txt exists in the same folder.

Open terminal or command prompt.

Run the file using:

bash
Copy
Edit
python Assignment4.py
